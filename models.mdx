# Lux Foundation Models

OpenAGI provides two specialized foundation models for computer use, each optimized for different scenarios. Both models share the same API interface but offer distinct trade-offs between speed and reasoning depth.

## Available Models

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="lux-actor-1" icon="zap" color="#10b981">
    **Fast & Responsive**
    
    Optimized for speed and real-time UI control. Perfect for direct action loops and high-throughput automation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="lux-thinker-1" icon="brain" color="#8b5cf6">
    **Deep Reasoning**
    
    Optimized for complex planning and careful decision-making. Best for multi-step tasks and ambiguous scenarios.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to Use Each Model

### lux-actor-1: Speed & Responsiveness

**Best for:**
- Fast, responsive UI control
- High-throughput automation
- Short-horizon tasks (tasks completed in < 20 steps without complex reasoning)
- Real-time UX (CLI/desktop control loops)
- Direct "observe → decide → act" loops

### Prompting Guide

To get the best results from `lux-actor-1`, provide clear, step-by-step instructions. Avoid vague or high-level goals.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good (Concise)
"Click 'Settings' then click 'Profile', and Type 'John Doe' in 'Name', and then click 'Save'"
```

```text Bad (Vague)
Fix my profile info
```
</CodeGroup>

**Typical usage (via DefaultAgent):**
The `DefaultAgent` provides a simple loop for executing direct instructions with the actor model.

<Note>
**Before running**: Ensure your desktop is set up properly. Open a browser to a blank page with minimal tabs, close other applications to avoid overlapping windows, and keep the desktop uncluttered. The agent "sees" your screen just like you do—a clean environment improves accuracy.
</Note>

```python
import asyncio

from oagi.agent.default import AsyncDefaultAgent
from oagi import AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler, AsyncScreenshotMaker

async def run_actor_agent():
    # Initialize the default agent with the actor model
    agent = AsyncDefaultAgent(model="lux-actor-1")
    
    # Execute a direct instruction
    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Go to Google.com, search timer, add 1 minute by clicking on the '+1:00', and start the timer",
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(run_actor_agent())
```

Here's the expected behavior of the code snippet above when run with the correct desktop environment.

<div style={{ padding: "62.5% 0 0 0", position: "relative" }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1140808440?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
    referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }}

  />
</div>


### Tasker Agent
The built-in `TaskerAgent` is designed for multi-step workflows, and it happily runs on top of `lux-actor-1`, which gives you fast, deterministic execution while the TaskerAgent handles planning, memory, and retries. You must define the task and sub-tasks (todos) before execution.

```python
import asyncio
from oagi import TaskerAgent, AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler, AsyncScreenshotMaker

async def run_tasker():
    agent = TaskerAgent(model="lux-actor-1")
    
    # 1. Define the high-level task and breakdown
    agent.set_task(
        task="Find a flight from Fukuoka to San Francisco",
        todos=[
          "Navigate to flights.google.com, set the arrival city to 'San Francisco' and click the first one from the dropdown",
          "Set the departure date to today, then set the return date two weeks from today, and click 'Search'",
          "Click on the first flight of the 'Top departing flights' and click the first of the 'Top returning flights'"
        ]
    )
    
    # 2. Execute the workflow
    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Find a flight", # Context for the agent
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(run_tasker())
```

Here's what the run will look like with the correct desktop setup.

<div style={{ padding: "75% 0 0 0", position: "relative" }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1140830837?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
    referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }}

### lux-thinker-1: Careful Planning

**Best for:**
- Tasks requiring multi-step planning
- Non-obvious action sequences
- Brittle or complex workflows
- Scenarios where errors are costly
- **Complex Examples:**
    - "Research the top 3 coffee shops in Tokyo and save their addresses to a text file"
    - "Compare flight prices on three different websites and book the cheapest one"
    - "Debug the failing test case by analyzing the logs and checking the UI state"

<Warning>
**Avoid using Thinker with TaskerAgent for simple execution loops.**
The `TaskerAgent` adds its own layer of reflection and planning. Combining this with `lux-thinker-1` (which also plans) can result in extremely slow execution times and redundant reasoning. Use `lux-thinker-1` for vague, complex goals, requiring hour-long executions.
</Warning>

### Usage in CLI and Custom Apps

`lux-thinker-1` is best suited for asynchronous workflows where a human is not waiting for immediate feedback, such as:
1.  **CLI Tools:** Running complex analysis or setup tasks via the command line.

    ```bash
    oagi agent run "Research the top 3 coffee shops in Tokyo and save their addresses to a text file" --model "lux-thinker-1"
    ```

2.  **Custom Clients:** Background workers or specialized applications built for specific business logic.

If you are building a custom application, you can implement your own client to handle these long-running tasks efficiently.

## Performance Characteristics

| Feature | lux-actor-1 | lux-thinker-1 |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Latency** | Lower | Higher |
| **Accuracy** | High for simple tasks | Higher for complex tasks |
| **Best Use** | Real-time control | Strategic planning |


## Best Practices

### Model Selection
- **Start with lux-actor-1** unless you have evidence the task needs deeper reasoning
- **Use lux-thinker-1** for planning, long running, and more complex tasks

### Environment Setup
- Maintain stable initial UI state (limit open tabs, avoid obstructive modals)
- Use reasonable screen resolution and scaling so targets are visible
- Provide explicit instructions rather than vague ones

## Pricing
