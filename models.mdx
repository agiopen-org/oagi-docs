# Lux Foundation Models

OpenAGI provides two specialized foundation models for computer use, each optimized for different scenarios. Both models share the same API interface but offer distinct trade-offs between speed and reasoning depth.

## Available Models

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="lux-actor-1" icon="zap" color="#10b981">
    **Fast & Responsive**
    
    Optimized for speed and real-time UI control. Perfect for direct action loops and high-throughput automation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="lux-thinker-1" icon="brain" color="#8b5cf6">
    **Deep Reasoning**
    
    Optimized for complex planning and careful decision-making. Best for multi-step tasks and ambiguous scenarios.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to Use Each Model

### lux-actor-1: Speed & Responsiveness

**Best for:**
- Fast, responsive UI control
- High-throughput automation
- Short-horizon tasks (tasks completed in < 10 steps without complex reasoning)
- Real-time UX (CLI/desktop control loops)
- Direct "observe → decide → act" loops

### Prompting Guide

To get the best results from `lux-actor-1`, provide clear, step-by-step instructions. Avoid vague or high-level goals.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good (Step-by-step)
1. Open the "Settings" menu
2. Click on "Profile"
3. Type "John Doe" into the "Name" field
4. Click "Save"
```

```text Bad (Vague)
Update my profile name to John Doe
```
</CodeGroup>

**Typical usage (via DefaultAgent):**
The `DefaultAgent` provides a simple loop for executing direct instructions with the actor model.

<Note>
**Before running**: Ensure your desktop is set up properly. Open a single Google Chrome window with minimal tabs, close other applications to avoid overlapping windows, and keep the desktop uncluttered. The agent "sees" your screen just like you do—a clean environment improves accuracy.
</Note>

```python
import asyncio

from oagi.agent.default import AsyncDefaultAgent
from oagi import AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler, AsyncScreenshotMaker

async def run_actor_agent():
    # Initialize the default agent with the actor model
    agent = AsyncDefaultAgent(model="lux-actor-1")
    
    # Execute a direct instruction
    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Go to google.com",
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(run_actor_agent())
```

### lux-thinker-1: Careful Planning

**Best for:**
- Tasks requiring multi-step planning
- Non-obvious action sequences
- Brittle or complex workflows
- Scenarios where errors are costly
- **Complex Examples:**
    - "Research the top 3 coffee shops in Tokyo and save their addresses to a text file"
    - "Compare flight prices on three different websites and book the cheapest one"
    - "Debug the failing test case by analyzing the logs and checking the UI state"

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher latency per decision
- Increased cost per action
- Not ideal for tight control loops

<Warning>
**Avoid using Thinker with TaskerAgent for simple execution loops.**
The `TaskerAgent` adds its own layer of reflection and planning. Combining this with `lux-thinker-1` (which also plans) can result in extremely slow execution times and redundant reasoning. Use `lux-thinker-1` primarily for the initial planning phase or for very difficult steps where the actor fails.
</Warning>


## Performance Characteristics

| Feature | lux-actor-1 | lux-thinker-1 |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Latency** | Lower | Higher |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Accuracy** | High for simple tasks | Higher for complex tasks |
| **Best Use** | Real-time control | Strategic planning |

## Integration with Agents

### Tasker Agent
The built-in `TaskerAgent` is designed for multi-step workflows. You must define the task and sub-tasks (todos) before execution.

```python
import asyncio
from oagi import TaskerAgent, AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler, AsyncScreenshotMaker

async def run_tasker():
    agent = TaskerAgent(model="lux-actor-1")
    
    # 1. Define the high-level task and breakdown
    agent.set_task(
        task="Find a flight from San Francisco to Tokyo",
        todos=["Open a browser", "Navigate to flights.google.com", "Set the departure date to today", "Set the return date two weeks from today", "Set the departure location to San Francisco", "Set the arrival location to Tokyo", "Click on the first flight and select the first return flight"]
    )
    
    # 2. Execute the workflow
    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Book the flight", # Context for the agent
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(run_tasker())
```

### Custom Agents
You can build and register your own custom agents using the `async_agent_register` decorator. This allows you to integrate them into the OAGI system.

```python
from oagi.agent.registry import async_agent_register
from oagi import AsyncAgent

@async_agent_register("my-custom-agent")
def create_my_agent(api_key: str, **kwargs) -> AsyncAgent:
    # Initialize and return your custom agent instance
    return MyCustomAgent(api_key=api_key, **kwargs)

# Usage
# agent = create_agent("my-custom-agent", api_key="...")
```

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
- **Start with lux-actor-1** unless you have evidence the task needs deeper reasoning
- **Use lux-thinker-1 selectively** for planning, brittle flows, or where retries are expensive
- **Consider hybrid approaches** for long tasks: thinker for planning, actor for execution

### Environment Setup
- Maintain stable initial UI state (limit open tabs, avoid obstructive modals)
- Use reasonable screen resolution and scaling so targets are visible
- Provide explicit instructions rather than vague ones

### Error Handling
```python
import asyncio

from oagi import TaskerAgent, AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler, AsyncScreenshotMaker

def verify_checkout():
    # Custom verification based on your UI (DOM queries, OCR, etc.)
    ...

async def guarded_checkout():
    handler = AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler()
    screenshots = AsyncScreenshotMaker()

    # Fast path with lux-actor-1
    agent = TaskerAgent(model="lux-actor-1", max_steps=15)
    agent.set_task("Navigate to checkout", ["Open cart", "Review items", "Go to checkout"])

    success = await agent.execute(
        instruction="Reach the checkout page",
        action_handler=handler,
        image_provider=screenshots,
    )

    if not success or not verify_checkout():
        # Fall back to deeper reasoning with lux-thinker-1
        thinker = TaskerAgent(model="lux-thinker-1", max_steps=40)
        thinker.set_task("Find checkout reliably", ["Search navigation", "Open checkout", "Confirm page"])
        await thinker.execute(
            instruction="Find and click checkout",
            action_handler=handler,
            image_provider=screenshots,
        )

asyncio.run(guarded_checkout())
```

## Pricing
