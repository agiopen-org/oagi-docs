# Using Agents

Agents provide high-level automation by managing the entire task execution workflow. Unlike Actors, which require manual step management, Agents handle the complete automation process from start to finish.

## DefaultAgent

Run tasks automatically with screenshot capture and action execution:

```typescript
import { DefaultActionHandler, DefaultAgent, ScreenshotMaker } from '@oagi/oagi';

async function main() {
  const agent = new DefaultAgent();

  await agent.execute(
    'Search weather on Google',
    new DefaultActionHandler(),
    new ScreenshotMaker(),
  );
};

main();
```

## Agent vs Actor

| Feature | Actor | Agent |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Control Level** | Fine-grained | High-level |
| **Setup Complexity** | Manual loop | Moderate |
| **Customization** | Full | Configurable |
| **Best For** | Custom logic and tooling | Production workflows |
