# Actors

Actors provide fine-grained control over task execution, allowing you to manage each step manually. Unlike higher-level agents, Actors give you complete control over the execution loop.

## Basic Actor Usage

For step-by-step control over task execution:

```typescript
import { Actor, DefaultActionHandler, ScreenshotMaker } from '@oagi/oagi';

async function main() {
  const actor = new Actor();
  await actor.initTask('Complete the form');

  const imageProvider = new ScreenshotMaker();
  const actionHandler = new DefaultActionHandler();

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    const image = await imageProvider.provide();
    const step = await actor.step(image);

    if (step.stop) break;

    await actionHandler.handle(step.actions);
  }
};

main();
```

## Actor Execution Flow

1. **Initialize** - Create actor and set task description
2. **Capture** - Take a screenshot of the current state
3. **Analyze** - Send screenshot to the model for analysis
4. **Receive** - Get the next `step` containing reasoning and actions
5. **Check** - Stop if the task is complete
6. **Execute** - Run the returned actions
7. **Repeat** - Continue until completion or `maxSteps`
