# Use the Desktop Application for Prototyping

The OpenAGI Desktop Application is a developer tool that lets you instantly test and visualize your agents without building a client from scratch.

It serves two main purposes:
1.  **Visual Playground:** A zero-setup way to see what the model sees and watch it control your computer.
2.  **Reference Implementation:** A concrete example of how a client should interact with the [OpenAGI Server](/concepts/server-architecture).

## Why use it?

*   **Instant Feedback:** Watch the agent's thought process, screenshot captures, and mouse movements in real-time.
*   **Debug Capabilities:** View raw logs and segment data to understand why an agent succeeded or failed.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Available for both macOS and Windows.

## Agent Modes

The Desktop Application supports three agent modes, each optimized for different use cases:

- **Actor** — Fast, responsive execution for well-defined tasks (under 20 steps)
- **Thinker** — Deep reasoning for ambiguous research and complex planning
- **Tasker** — Structured multi-step workflows with todo management

Switch between modes using the dropdown in the application interface:

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the App

### 2. Start Your Server

The desktop app needs a "brain" to talk to. Start your local OpenAGI server:

> You must set your `OAGI_API_KEY` and `OAGI_BASE_URL` environment variables before starting the server.

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OAGI_BASE_URL="https://api.agiopen.org"
oagi server start
```

For more details on server configuration, deployment options, and running the server programmatically, see the [Server Architecture](/concepts/server-architecture) guide.

### 3. Connect

Open the desktop application and enter your server URL (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Once connected, the app acts as the bridge, allowing the agent running on your server to control your desktop.

### 4. Send a Prompt

Once connected, you can type prompts directly into the application. The agent will execute your instructions in real-time on your desktop.

Try a simple example with the Actor model:

```
Open the Calculator
```

<Danger>
  In this example, the Calculator app is **in the dock** and the icon is **large enough** for the agent to see. Make sure target elements are visible and reasonably sized for best results.
