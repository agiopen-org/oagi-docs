# Desktop Application

The OpenAGI Desktop Application is a developer tool that lets you instantly test and visualize your agents without building a client from scratch.

It serves two main purposes:
1.  **Visual Playground:** A zero-setup way to see what the model sees and watch it control your computer.
2.  **Reference Implementation:** A concrete example of how a client should interact with the [OpenAGI Server](/server-architecture).

## Why use it?

*   **Instant Feedback:** Watch the agent's thought process, screenshot captures, and mouse movements in real-time.
*   **Debug Capabilities:** View raw logs and segment data to understand why an agent succeeded or failed.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Available for both macOS and Windows.

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the App

  <Card title="Download for Windows" icon="windows" href="#">
    Windows 10/11 (x64)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


### 2. Start Your Server

The desktop app needs a "brain" to talk to. Start your local OpenAGI server:

> You must set your `OAGI_API_KEY` and `OAGI_BASE_URL` environment variables before starting the server.

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OAGI_BASE_URL="https://api.agiopen.org"
oagi server start
```

For more details on server configuration, deployment options, and running the server programmatically, see the [Server Architecture](/concepts/server-architecture) guide.

### 3. Connect

Open the desktop application and enter your server URL (default: `http://0.0.0.0:8000`). Once connected, the app acts as the bridge, allowing the agent running on your server to control your desktop.

## Building Your Own

The Desktop Application is just one example of a client. If you want to build a custom computer-use product (like a headless background worker or a specialized browser agent), you can build your own client that speaks the same protocol.
