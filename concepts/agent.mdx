# Agent

An **Agent** automates the entire workflow end-to-end, providing the highest level of abstraction in the OpenAGI system. Unlike Actors that return steps for manual execution, Agents handle everything automatically.

## Purpose

Agents orchestrate complete automation workflows by managing all components—from screenshot capture to action execution—without requiring manual intervention between steps.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Use Actor** for API communication with Lux models
- **Capture Screenshots** automatically at each step
- **Execute Actions** without manual intervention
- **Handle Completion** and determine when tasks are finished

## Execution Flow

The Agent follows a fully automated pattern:

```
Agent → Screenshot → Actor → Step → Execute → Loop → Complete
```

1. **Agent** initiates the task
2. **Screenshot** captures current state automatically
3. **Actor** communicates with the API
4. **Step** receives reasoning and actions
5. **Execute** performs actions automatically
6. **Loop** continues until completion
7. **Complete** when task is finished

## Key Difference: Agent vs Actor

The fundamental difference lies in execution responsibility:

**Actor:**
- Returns Steps for **you** to execute
- Provides fine-grained control
- Requires manual step management
- You handle screenshot capture and action execution

**Agent:**
- Executes everything **automatically**
- Provides high-level automation
- Handles the complete workflow
- Manages all components internally

## When to Use Agent

**Choose Agent when you need:**
- Complete end-to-end automation
- Minimal setup and configuration
- Production-ready workflows
- Standard automation patterns

**Choose Actor when you need:**
- Custom logic between steps
- Fine-grained control over execution
- Integration with existing systems
- Custom error handling or retry logic

## Agent Types

OpenAGI provides different agent implementations:

- **AsyncDefaultAgent** - Standard async agent for most tasks
- **Custom Agents** - Implement your own specialized behavior
- **Registered Agents** - Factory-created agents available via CLI

## Architecture

```
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌───────┐
│  Agent  │───▶│ ImageProvider│───▶│ Actor │
│         │    │ (Screenshot) │    │       │
└─────────┘    └──────────────┘    └───────┘
     │                                  │
     │         ┌──────────────┐         │
     └────────▶│ActionHandler │◀────────┘
               │ (Execute)    │
               └──────────────┘
```

The Agent coordinates all components to provide seamless automation.
