# Step

A `Step` is the fundamental unit of execution in an OpenAGI agent's workflow. It represents a single logical progression where the agent analyzes the current state, reasons about what to do next, and executes a set of actions.

> [!NOTE]
> `Step` objects are generated by the OpenAGI model during inference. Developers are not expected to manually create `Step` instances. They are concrete classes used by the system to structure agent behavior.

## Components

A `Step` consists of three main components:

- **`reason`** (`str | None`): An optional explanation or thought process behind the step. This helps in debugging and understanding the agent's decision-making.
- **`actions`** (`list[Action]`): A list of specific `Action` objects to be executed. These can be interactions (like clicking, typing) or control commands (like waiting, finishing).
- **`stop`** (`bool`): A flag indicating whether the agent should terminate execution after this step. Defaults to `False`.

## Usage

### Python Example

Here is how you can define a `Step` using the `oagi` Python SDK:

```python
# Assuming 'step' is a Step object returned by the agent
print(f"Reasoning: {step.reason}")

for action in step.actions:
    print(f"Action: {action.type} -> {action.argument}")

if step.stop:
    print("Task completed!")
```

### JSON Representation

When serialized, a `Step` looks like this:

```json
{
  "reason": "Submitting the login form after entering credentials",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "click",
      "argument": "submit_button_id",
      "count": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "wait",
      "argument": "2000",
      "count": 1
    }
  ],
  "stop": false
}
```
