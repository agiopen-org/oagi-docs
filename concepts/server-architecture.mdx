# Server Architecture

The OAGI server acts as a bridge between your agents and the desktop environment. While you can run agents locally (as shown in the Quickstart), running a dedicated server is useful for:
- **Remote Automation**: Controlling a desktop on a different machine.
- **Centralized Management**: Handling API keys and configuration in one place.
- **Session Persistence**: Keeping track of long-running automation tasks.

## Running the Server

You can start the server using the CLI or programmatically via the Python SDK.

### Option 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to start the server is with the `oagi` command-line tool. This comes installed with the `oagi` package.

```bash
# Start the server on the default port (8000)
oagi server start
```

You can customize the host and port if needed:

```bash
oagi server start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Option 2: Using the Python SDK

For more control, or to integrate the server into an existing Python application, you can use the `Server` class directly.

```python
import uvicorn
from oagi.server import create_app

# Create the FastAPI app
app = create_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run with uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

## Connecting Clients

Once the server is running, desktop clients (the "bridge") can connect to it via Socket.IO.

<Info>
**Using the Desktop Application**

The fastest way to try this loop is with the [Desktop Application](/concepts/desktop-application). It provides a ready-made bridge that:

- Shows you what the model sees (screenshot stream) and how it moves the mouse/keyboard
- Streams logs, tool calls, and errors so you can debug agent behavior
- Works on macOS and Windows without building your own client

**Steps**
1. Start your local server (e.g., `oagi server start`) with `OAGI_API_KEY` / `OAGI_BASE_URL` set.
2. Launch the desktop app and point it at the server URL (default `http://0.0.0.0:8000`).
3. Send commands into the Desktop Application
</Info>

If you are building your own client, implement the same handshake: connect over Socket.IO, request a session, send screenshots, and execute incoming actions.

## Deployment Tips

- **Security**: If exposing the server to the internet, ensure you set up proper authentication and use HTTPS.
- **Scaling**: For high-volume deployments, you can run multiple server instances behind a load balancer.
