# Actor

An **Actor** is the core component that manages the conversation with the OAGI API. It provides fine-grained control over task execution by handling each step of the computer-use process manually.

## Purpose

The Actor serves as the bridge between your application and the Lux foundation models, orchestrating the step-by-step execution of computer-use tasks.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Initialize Task** - Set up the task description and context
- **Send Screenshots** - Capture and transmit current screen state to the API
- **Receive Steps** - Get structured responses with reasoning and actions
- **Maintain Context** - Keep track of task progress and conversation history

## Execution Flow

The Actor follows a simple, repeatable pattern:

```
Init Task → Send Screenshot → Get Step → (You Execute) → Repeat
```

1. **Initialize** the task with a description
2. **Send** a screenshot of the current state
3. **Receive** a Step object with reasoning and actions
4. **Execute** the actions (handled by you or an ActionHandler)
5. **Repeat** until the task is complete

## When to Use Actor

**Choose Actor when you need:**
- Manual control over each execution step (10–20 steps)
- Custom action filtering or processing
- Integration with existing automation systems
- Detailed logging and debugging capabilities

**Choose TaskerAgent when you need:**
- Longer workflows that should be broken into a to-do list
- Automatic orchestration of Actors for each sub-task
- Guardrails around retries, memory, and progress summaries
- The same fine-grained control as Actor, but without writing the loop yourself

TaskerAgent uses Actors under the hood: it decomposes a goal into todos, dispatches each to an Actor, and relays screenshots/actions through the same handlers you already use. Reach for Tasker when you want automation with structure; fall back to raw Actor when you need to inspect or modify every step yourself.

## Core Components

The Actor works with several key components:

- **Step** - Contains reasoning and actions for the next move
- **ActionHandler** - Executes the actions (clicking, typing, etc.)
- **ImageProvider** - Captures screenshots of the current state
