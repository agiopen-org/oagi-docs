# Screenshot Provider

The Screenshot Provider is the component responsible for capturing the visual state of the environment. It acts as the "eyes" of the agent, providing the raw visual data that the model analyzes to make decisions.

## Available Implementations

OpenAGI provides two standard implementations out of the box:

### 1. AsyncScreenshotMaker (Recommended)
The `AsyncScreenshotMaker` is the standard choice for most agent applications. It wraps the screenshot capture in a thread pool to ensure that taking a screenshot (which is an I/O bound operation) does not block your agent's async event loop.

```python
from oagi import AsyncScreenshotMaker

# Non-blocking capture
image_provider = AsyncScreenshotMaker()
image = await image_provider()
```

### 2. ScreenshotMaker (Synchronous)
The `ScreenshotMaker` is the synchronous version, suitable for simple scripts or blocking contexts where async execution isn't required.

```python
from oagi import ScreenshotMaker

# Blocking capture
image_provider = ScreenshotMaker()
image = image_provider()
```

## Configuration

You can customize how screenshots are captured using `ImageConfig`. This is crucial for balancing **performance** (speed/latency) and **quality** (model accuracy).

### ImageConfig Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `format` | Image format (JPEG, PNG) | `JPEG` |
| `width` | Target width to resize to | `1260` |
| `height` | Target height to resize to | `700` |
| `quality` | JPEG quality (1-100) | `85` |

### Why Resize?
Sending full-resolution screenshots (e.g., 4K or Retina) to VLM (Vision Language Models) can be slow and expensive.
- **Latency**: Larger images take longer to encode and upload.
- **Cost**: More pixels often mean higher token usage.
- **Accuracy**: Most models are trained on standard resolutions (like 1280x720) and may not benefit from ultra-high resolution.

## Usage Example

Here is how to configure a provider with custom settings and pass it to an agent:

```python
import asyncio
from oagi import AsyncScreenshotMaker, ImageConfig, TaskerAgent

async def main():
    # 1. Configure for higher quality (e.g., for text-heavy apps)
    config = ImageConfig(
        format="PNG",
        width=1920,
        height=1080,
        optimize=True
    )
    
    # 2. Initialize the provider
    provider = AsyncScreenshotMaker(config=config)
    
    # 3. Use it in your agent
    agent = TaskerAgent()
    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Analyze the spreadsheet",
        action_handler=..., 
        image_provider=provider  # <--- Passed here
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Best Practices

<Check>
**Use Async**: Always use `AsyncScreenshotMaker` when running agents to keep your application responsive.
</Check>

<Tip>
**Tune Resolution**: Start with the default (1260x700). Only increase it if the agent struggles to read small text or identify fine details.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Multi-Monitor Setups**: The default provider typically captures the primary display. Ensure your target application is on the primary screen or configure the underlying capture tool to select the correct region.
</Warning>
