# Execution Report

When you run an agent using the `oagi agent run` command, OpenAGI can generate an **execution report**—a step-by-step audit trail of everything the agent did. This is invaluable for debugging, understanding agent decision-making, and sharing results.

## Generating a Report

To generate an execution report, use the `--export` flag with your desired format:

<CodeGroup>
```bash html
oagi agent run "<your-task>" --model lux-actor-1 --export html
```
```bash markdown
oagi agent run "<your-task>" --model lux-actor-1 --export markdown
```
```bash json
oagi agent run "<your-task>" --model lux-actor-1 --export json
```
</CodeGroup>

| Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `html` | Rich visual report with embedded screenshots |
| `markdown` | Portable text-based report |
| `json` | Machine-readable structured data |

This produces an `execution_report.<format>` file in your working directory.

To customize the output filename, use the `--export-file` argument:

```bash
oagi agent run "<your-task>" --model lux-actor-1 --export html --export-file my-report.html
```

## Report Structure

The execution report is organized around **todos** (high-level tasks) and **steps** (individual actions within each todo).

### Todos

Each todo represents a discrete objective the agent is working toward. The report clearly marks:
- **Start of todo** — When the agent begins working on a task
- **End of todo** — When the task is completed

### Steps

Within each todo, the agent executes multiple steps. Each step contains:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Timestamp** | When the step was executed |
| **Screenshot** | The screen state at that moment (embedded as base64 PNG) |
| **Reasoning** | The agent's thought process explaining its decision |
| **Planned Actions** | The action(s) the agent will execute |

## Action Types

The report shows various action types the agent can perform:

```
click: 249, 116      # Click at screen coordinates
type: Hello world    # Type text
hotkey: enter        # Press keyboard keys
scroll: down         # Scroll in a direction
finish:              # Mark subtask complete
```

## Planning Phases

The report includes planning sections that show the agent's high-level thinking:

- **Initial Planning** — Strategy formulated at the start of each todo
- **Reflection** — Mid-task evaluation of progress
- **Summary** — Final assessment after completing a todo

## Export Formats

### HTML
Open the generated `execution_report.html` in any web browser. The report is self-contained—all screenshots are embedded directly in the HTML, so you can share the single file without dependencies.

### Markdown
The `execution_report.md` file is ideal for including in documentation, GitHub issues, or any text-based workflow. Screenshots are referenced as external files.

### JSON
The `execution_report.json` file provides structured data for programmatic analysis, CI/CD pipelines, or custom tooling.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check timestamps** — Long gaps between steps may indicate the agent is stuck
2. **Review reasoning** — Understand why the agent made specific decisions
3. **Examine screenshots** — Verify the agent saw what you expected
4. **Look for errors** — Failed actions are highlighted with error styling
