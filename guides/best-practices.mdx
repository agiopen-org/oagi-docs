# Best Practices

This guide consolidates the most important strategies for building reliable, production-grade computer use agents with Lux.

## 1. Environment Setup

The "physical" environment of the computer is the foundation of reliability.

-   **Clean Browser State:** Close unnecessary tabs. 30+ open tabs can interfere with clicking accuracy and distract the model.
-   **Screen Resolution:** Use standard 1080p scaling. High-resolution screens (Retina/4K) can make icons too small for the model to detect accurately.
-   **Pre-opened Applications:** Have your browser or target application ready at the starting page. This saves steps and reduces the chance of navigation errors.
-   **Stable UI:** Avoid dynamic layouts or popups that appear randomly if possible.

## 2. Prompting Strategy

How you ask matters as much as what you ask.

### Be Specific and Action-Oriented
Computer use models thrive on concrete instructions.

-   ❌ **Vague:** "Fix the computer"
-   ✅ **Specific:** "Open the system settings and click the toggle to turn on dark mode"

### Break Down Complex Tasks
If a task involves multiple logical steps, break it down.

-   ❌ **Too Complex:** "Manage my Shopify store"
-   ✅ **Broken Down:** "Add 3 products to inventory, then update their descriptions"

### Specify Success Criteria
Tell the model how to know it's done.

-   **Example:** "Book a meeting for 2pm. Stop when you see the 'Meeting Confirmed' banner."

## 3. Model Selection

Choose the right tool for the job to balance speed, cost, and accuracy.

| Model | Best For | Avoid When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lux Actor** (`lux-actor-1`) | Fast execution (1s/step), simple linear tasks (10-20 steps). | You need complex reasoning, comparison, or handling ambiguous instructions. |
| **Lux Thinker** (`lux-thinker-1`) | Complex planning, comparison tasks ("find cheapest"), handling ambiguity. | You need low latency or are running a simple click-path. |
| **Tasker Agent** | Structured workflows requiring some planning but mostly execution. | You need raw speed and have a well defined task. |

## 4. Handling Failure

Build resilience into your prompts and workflows.

-   **Handle UI Variations:** "If the 'Login' button isn't visible, scroll down or look for a 'Sign In' link in the menu."
-   **Iterate with Hints:** If Lux fails, don't just retry. Add a hint: "You missed the 'Next' button because it's at the very bottom. Scroll down first."

## 5. What to Avoid

The **Actor model** specifically struggles with:
-   **Comparison tasks** (e.g., "find the cheapest flight").
-   **Complex dropdown menus and filtering**.
-   **Vague commands** requiring interpretation.

For these scenarios, upgrade to the **Thinker model** or use the **Tasker Agent**.
