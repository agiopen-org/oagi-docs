## Get started in three steps

Build your first AI agent that can see, think, and act on any computer interface.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: Python 3.10+ installed on your system
</Info>

### Step 1: Install OpenAGI

Install the OAGI library with all features included:

```bash
pip install oagi
```

<Tip>
  This installs the complete SDK including desktop automation, server capabilities, and all dependencies.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Set up authentication

Get your API key and configure your environment:

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OAGI_BASE_URL="http://api.agiopen.org"
```

<Note>
  Your API key provides access to Lux foundation models and includes free credits to get started. Retrieve it from the OpenAGI Platform dashboard at [developer.agiopen.org](https://developer.agiopen.org/) and see more information in the <Link href="/python-sdk/authentication">Authentication guide</Link>.
</Note>

### Before you run: Prepare your desktop

For the best results, your desktop environment needs to be clean and simple. The agent "sees" your screen just like you do.

    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/good-setup.png" alt="Good desktop setup" />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/good-setup.png" alt="Good desktop setup" />
    
    - Single, large browser window on https://google.com
    - Clean desktop background
    - Minimal distractions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bad Setup (Avoid this)" icon="xmark">
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bad-setup.png" alt="Bad desktop setup" />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/bad-setup.png" alt="Bad desktop setup" />
    
    - **Too many tabs:** 20+ tabs make it hard to find the right one.
    - **Small window:** The agent needs to see page content clearly.
    - **Messy desktop:** Multiple overlapping apps confuse the visual analysis.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 3: Run your first agent

<Warning>
  **macOS Users:** You will likely see a permission error the first time you run this.
  
  You must grant **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions to your terminal app (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2, VS Code).
  Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** to enable these, then restart your terminal.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  For the most reliable execution, declutter the desktop before running agents. Keep distracting apps closed, make sure key windows (like a browser on google.com) are clearly visible, and avoid overlapping UI elements so the model can recognize targets quickly.
</Warning>

Launch a Lux computer-use agent with a single command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Go to https://agiopen.org" --model "lux-actor-1"
```

**What happens next:**
- The agent takes a screenshot of your current screen
- Lux analyzes the visual interface and plans the task
- The agent executes actions (clicks, types, scrolls) to complete the goal
- You'll see real-time feedback as the agent works


## Next steps

Now that you have your first agent running, explore these capabilities:

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission errors on macOS/Linux">
    The agent needs accessibility permissions to control your computer:
    
    **macOS**: Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility and add your terminal application.
    
    **Linux**: Ensure your user has access to input devices or run with appropriate permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent not taking actions">
    If the agent sees the screen but doesn't act:
    
    1. Check that `PyautoguiActionHandler` is installed: `pip install oagi[desktop]`
    2. Verify your screen resolution is supported
    3. Try a simpler task first to test the setup
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API key issues">
    If you're getting authentication errors:
    
    1. Verify your API key starts with `sk-`
    2. Check that `OAGI_BASE_URL` is set correctly
    3. Ensure you have remaining credits in your account
