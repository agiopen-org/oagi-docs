## Get started in three steps

Build your first AI agent that can see, think, and act on any computer interface.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: Python 3.10+ installed on your system
</Info>

### Step 1: Install OpenAGI

Install the OAGI library with all features included:

```bash
pip install oagi
```

<Tip>
  This installs the complete SDK including desktop automation, server capabilities, and all dependencies.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Set up authentication

Get your API key and configure your environment:

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OAGI_BASE_URL="http://api.agiopen.org"
```

<Note>
  Your API key provides access to Lux foundation models and includes free credits to get started.
</Note>

### Step 3: Run your first agent

Launch a Lux computer-use agent with a single command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Open Chrome and navigate to https://agiopen.org" --model "lux-actor-1"
```

**What happens next:**
- The agent takes a screenshot of your current screen
- Lux analyzes the visual interface and plans the task
- The agent executes actions (clicks, types, scrolls) to complete the goal
- You'll see real-time feedback as the agent works

## Advanced Usage

### Start a local server

For browser-based automation or custom integrations:

```bash
oagi server start
```

This starts a Socket.IO server that can communicate with browser extensions or custom clients.

### Python SDK example

For more control, use the Python SDK directly:

```python
from oagi import ShortTask, ScreenshotMaker, PyautoguiActionHandler

# Initialize the task
task = ShortTask()

# Run in automated mode
completed = task.auto_mode(
    "Search for weather in Tokyo",
    max_steps=10,
    executor=PyautoguiActionHandler(),  # Executes actions
    image_provider=ScreenshotMaker(),   # Captures screenshots
)

print(f"Task completed: {completed}")
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission errors on macOS/Linux">
    The agent needs accessibility permissions to control your computer:
    
    **macOS**: Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility and add your terminal application.
    
    **Linux**: Ensure your user has access to input devices or run with appropriate permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent not taking actions">
    If the agent sees the screen but doesn't act:
    
    1. Check that `PyautoguiActionHandler` is installed: `pip install oagi[desktop]`
    2. Verify your screen resolution is supported
    3. Try a simpler task first to test the setup
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API key issues">
    If you're getting authentication errors:
    
    1. Verify your API key starts with `sk-`
    2. Check that `OAGI_BASE_URL` is set correctly
    3. Ensure you have remaining credits in your account
