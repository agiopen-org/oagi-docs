## Get started in three steps

Build your first AI agent that can see, think, and act on any computer interface.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: Python 3.10+ installed on your system
</Info>

### Step 1: Install OpenAGI

Install the OAGI library with all features included:

```bash
pip install oagi
```

<Tip>
  This installs the complete SDK including desktop automation, server capabilities, and all dependencies.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Set up authentication

Get your API key and configure your environment:

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OAGI_BASE_URL="http://api.agiopen.org"
```

<Note>
  Your API key provides access to Lux foundation models and includes free credits to get started. Retrieve it from the OpenAGI Platform dashboard at [main.d1z3jyp67cosi.amplifyapp.com](https://main.d1z3jyp67cosi.amplifyapp.com/) and see more information in the <Link href="/python-sdk/authentication">Authentication guide</Link>.
</Note>

### Step 3: Run your first agent

Launch a Lux computer-use agent with a single command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Open Chrome and navigate to https://agiopen.org" --model "lux-actor-1"
```

**What happens next:**
- The agent takes a screenshot of your current screen
- Lux analyzes the visual interface and plans the task
- The agent executes actions (clicks, types, scrolls) to complete the goal
- You'll see real-time feedback as the agent works

<Warning>
  For the most reliable execution, declutter the desktop before running agents. Keep distracting apps closed, make sure key windows (like Chrome) are clearly visible, and avoid overlapping UI elements so the model can recognize targets quickly.
</Warning>

## Next steps

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission errors on macOS/Linux">
    The agent needs accessibility permissions to control your computer:
    
    **macOS**: Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility and add your terminal application.
    
    **Linux**: Ensure your user has access to input devices or run with appropriate permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent not taking actions">
    If the agent sees the screen but doesn't act:
    
    1. Check that `PyautoguiActionHandler` is installed: `pip install oagi[desktop]`
    2. Verify your screen resolution is supported
    3. Try a simpler task first to test the setup
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API key issues">
    If you're getting authentication errors:
    
    1. Verify your API key starts with `sk-`
    2. Check that `OAGI_BASE_URL` is set correctly
    3. Ensure you have remaining credits in your account
