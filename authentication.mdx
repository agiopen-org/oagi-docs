## Get your API key

1. Visit the **OpenAGI Developer Platform** dashboard at [main.d1z3jyp67cosi.amplifyapp.com](https://main.d1z3jyp67cosi.amplifyapp.com/).
2. Sign in with your developer account.
3. Navigate to **API Keys → Create key** and copy the generated value (keys start with `sk-`).
4. Store the key securely—treat it like a password.

<Warning>
  Do not embed API keys directly in repositories or client-side code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager instead.
</Warning>

## Configure environment variables

Set your credentials before running the SDK or CLI:

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
export OAGI_BASE_URL="https://api.agiopen.org"
```

If you are using a `.env` file (supported by `ServerConfig` and most examples):

```bash
echo "OAGI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" >> .env
echo "OAGI_BASE_URL=https://api.agiopen.org" >> .env
```

## Rotate or revoke keys

1. Return to the Developer Platform dashboard.
2. Delete any compromised key and issue a new one.
3. Update your deployment secrets immediately to avoid downtime.

## Next steps

- Follow the [Installation guide](/python-sdk/installation) to finish SDK setup.
- Review the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to launch your first agent.
