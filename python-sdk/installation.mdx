# Installation

## Package Options

OAGI Python SDK offers flexible installation options:

### Full Installation (Recommended)

```bash
pip install oagi
```

Installs the `oagi-core` package **plus** every optional extra. Use this when you want the quickest path to a complete setup (desktop + server) with one command.

### Core Only

```bash
pip install oagi-core
```

This installs only the core SDK and no optional dependencies. Choose this if you’re building your own tooling around the HTTP client/agents and don’t need desktop or server stacks. You can always layer extras later (see below).

### With Extras

```bash
# Desktop automation features
pip install oagi-core[desktop]

# Server features
pip install oagi-core[server]

# Both extras
pip install oagi-core[desktop,server]
```

| Extra | Installs | When to choose |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `desktop` | PyAutoGUI, screenshot helpers, and other local-execution deps | You are building a desktop bridge or client app that captures screenshots and executes actions locally. |
| `server` | FastAPI, Uvicorn, python-socketio, pydantic-settings | You plan to run the Socket.IO coordination server and need the web stack but not the desktop UI libraries. |
| `desktop,server` | Both sets above | You are developing on one machine that needs to run the remote server and a desktop executor (e.g., for local testing). |

Keeping them separate prevents desktop-only devs from pulling server frameworks (and vice versa) while still making it easy to install both when required.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- For desktop automation: Display access

## Setup

### 1. Get API Key

Get your API key from OAGI Platform.

### 2. Set Credentials

**Environment Variables (Recommended):**

```bash
export OAGI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OAGI_BASE_URL="https://api.agiopen.org"
```

**In Code:**

```python
from oagi import AsyncDefaultAgent

agent = AsyncDefaultAgent(
    api_key="sk-...",
    base_url="https://api.agiopen.org"
)
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```python
import oagi
print(oagi.__version__)

# Test with CLI
oagi version
```

## Package Structure

- **oagi-core**: Core package with actual code
- **oagi**: Metapackage that installs oagi-core with all extras

Both packages use the same import:

```python
from oagi import AsyncDefaultAgent, Actor, Action
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Features

```bash
# Check installed extras
pip show oagi-core

# Install missing extras
pip install oagi-core[desktop,server]
```
