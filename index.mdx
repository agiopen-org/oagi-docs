# Lux: Foundation Model for Computer Use

Welcome to the developer documentation for **Lux**, OpenAGI's foundation model that enables AI agents to operate computers just like humans do.

## What is Computer Use?

Computer Use represents one of the newest and most exciting areas of AI. Unlike traditional AI models that only process text or images, **computer use models** understand and interact with graphical user interfaces—all the buttons, menus, text boxes, and windows you see on your screen.

Think of it as an AI agent that can:
- **See** your screen through screenshots
- **Understand** goals given in natural language  
- **Act** by clicking, typing, and scrolling to complete tasks

### How It Works

Computer use models are **multimodal**, processing multiple types of information simultaneously:

**The Goal**
```
"Open Chrome, search for today's weather, and copy the forecast into Slack"
"Scroll through Jira, open ticket #1234, and leave a comment saying it is complete"
"Download a CSV, open it in Sheets, and copy all data to a new sheet"
```

**The Vision**
The model takes screenshots to "see" the current state of the screen

**The Actions**
Instead of just text responses, the model outputs specific actions:
- `click(x, y)` on buttons or links
- `type("text")` into input fields  
- `scroll()` to navigate pages
- `drag_and_drop(item, location)` to move elements

This runs in a continuous loop: **action → screenshot → next action** until the goal is complete.

## Why Computer Use Matters

### Beyond Chat Interfaces

**Traditional AI**: You give it text, it gives you text back. It lives inside a chat window.

**Computer Use AI**: You give it a task, and it leaves the chat to use any application on your computer—browsers, email clients, spreadsheets, design tools—to accomplish real work.

### True Digital Assistance

This technology enables **general-purpose agents** that can learn to use any software interface, moving from simple automation scripts to intelligent assistants that adapt to new applications.

## The Computer Use Landscape

Major AI labs are actively building computer use capabilities:

- **Google**: Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model for UI navigation
- **OpenAI**: Computer-Using Agent (CUA) with GPT-4o  
- **Amazon**: Nova Act for autonomous web browser actions
- **Microsoft**: Magma for interface interpretation

**Lux** by OpenAGI provides developers with production-ready access to this cutting-edge technology with the highest accuracy performance based on evaluations in Online-Mind2Web.
