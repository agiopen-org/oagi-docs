# Lux: Foundation Model for Computer Use

**Lux** is an AI model that operates computers like a human. It views the screen, understands natural language goals, and outputs actions (clicks, typing, scrolling) to complete tasks across any application.

## How It Works

Lux operates in a continuous **Action-Observation Loop**:

1.  **Goal**: The agent receives a task (e.g., "Open a browser and navigate to https://agiopen.org").
2.  **Vision**: It analyzes a screenshot of the current screen state.
3.  **Action**: It generates the next specific UI interaction (click, type, etc.).
4.  **Feedback**: The action is executed, a new screenshot is taken, and the loop repeats.
