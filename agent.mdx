# The TaskerAgent

**lux-actor-1** is OpenAGI's high-speed foundation model for computer use, optimized for real-time UI control and responsiveness.

The easiest way to use **lux-actor-1** is with the **TaskerAgent**, which wraps the model with planning, screenshot capture, and action streaming so you can focus on describing tasks, not wiring loops.

<Callout>
  **Why TaskerAgent?** You get the same low-latency reasoning from lux-actor-1, plus automatic todo management, progress memory, and retries. No need to stitch together screenshot uploads or action execution yourself.
</Callout>

## Minimal setup

1. Install the SDK ([Installation](/python-sdk/installation)) and load your OAGI API key.
2. Pick an action handler + image provider (see [Handlers](/python-sdk/handlers)).
3. Describe the overall task and todos, then call `execute()`.

```python
import asyncio

from oagi import TaskerAgent
from oagi import AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler, AsyncScreenshotMaker

async def main():
    agent = TaskerAgent(api_key="YOUR_KEY", model="lux-actor-1")

    agent.set_task(
        task="Check build status and post update",
        todos=[
            "Open CI dashboard",
            "Verify latest build",
            "Post summary in chat"
        ],
    )

    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Run through the checklist",
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

That’s it: behind the scenes, TaskerAgent talks to lux-actor-1 for you, keeps a PlannerMemory of todos/deliverables, and routes every action to your client-side handler.

## What developers need to remember

- **Stay on TaskerAgent unless you need custom loops.** Direct lux-actor-1 usage requires manual screenshot uploads, action parsing, retries, and state management. TaskerAgent already handles those concerns.
- **Bring your own execution layer.** TaskerAgent emits structured actions and screenshot requests; your desktop bridge (PyAutoGUI, Socket.IO client, etc.) simply plugs into those interfaces.
- **Inspect memory for status.** Call `agent.get_memory()` to see which todos succeeded, summaries, and remaining work—perfect for UI surfaces or alerts.

Want more control later? You can extend TaskerAgent with custom planners, different handlers, or observers, but the minimal flow above is enough to put lux-actor-1 to work in minutes.
