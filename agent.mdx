# The TaskerAgent

**lux-actor-1** is OpenAGI's high-speed foundation model for computer use, optimized for real-time UI control and responsiveness.

The easiest way to use **lux-actor-1** is with the **TaskerAgent**, which wraps the model with planning, screenshot capture, and action streaming so you can focus on describing tasks, not wiring loops.

<Callout>
  **Why TaskerAgent?** You get the same low-latency reasoning from lux-actor-1, plus automatic todo management, progress memory, and retries. No need to stitch together screenshot uploads or action execution yourself.
</Callout>

## Minimal setup

1. Install the Python SDK with `pip install oagi` and load your OAGI API key.
2. Describe the overall task and todos, then call `execute()`.

<Tip>
  **Before you run:** Ensure your desktop is clean and your browser is open. The agent needs to "see" the screen clearly to interact with it.
</Tip>

```python
import asyncio

# Captures the screenshot from your local computer
from oagi import AsyncScreenshotMaker 

# Controls your local keyboard and mouse based on the model predicted actions
from oagi import AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler 
from oagi import TaskerAgent

async def main():
    agent = TaskerAgent(api_key="YOUR_KEY", model="lux-actor-1")

    agent.set_task(
        task="Use chase to calculate mortgage payments",
        todos=[
            "Go to https://www.chase.com/personal/mortgage/calculators-resources/mortgage-calculator",
            "Scroll down to 'Customize your info' and change the Credit score to 'Very good (700-739)'",
            "Set the 'Property use' to 'Investment property' and set 'Property type' to 'Condo' ",
            "For the County type 'San Francisco' and select CA, San Francisco from the autocomplete dropdotn",
            "Set the property price to 2000000, the down payment to '400000', and click 'Loan Options'",
        ]
    )

    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Use chase to calculate mortgage payments",
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

This is the expected behavior if you run the above with the correct desktop setup.

<div style={{ padding: "62.62% 0 0 0", position: "relative" }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1140801936?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
    referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    title="OpenAGI - Chase Mortgage Calculator Example"
  />
</div>



That’s it: behind the scenes, TaskerAgent talks to lux-actor-1 for you, keeps a PlannerMemory of todos, and routes every action to your client-side handler.

## Understanding Tasks

To get the best results from TaskerAgent, it helps to understand how it plans and executes work.

- **Task**: The high-level goal you want to achieve. This sets the context for the entire session.
- **Todos**: A sequential list of steps the agent should follow. Think of this as a checklist you would give to a human intern.

### Best Practices for Todos
- **Be specific**: Instead of "Research", say something to the effect of "Search X on Google, click on the first result, and find this page, and fill in the form with these specific details".
- **Start with verbs**: "Open", "Click", "Type".
- **Keep it linear**: Break complex workflows into simple, logical steps.
