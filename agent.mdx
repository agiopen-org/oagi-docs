# The TaskerAgent

**lux-actor-1** is OpenAGI's high-speed foundation model for computer use, optimized for real-time UI control and responsiveness.

The easiest way to use **lux-actor-1** is with the **TaskerAgent**, which wraps the model with planning, screenshot capture, and action streaming so you can focus on describing tasks, not wiring loops.

<Callout>
  **Why TaskerAgent?** You get the same low-latency reasoning from lux-actor-1, plus automatic todo management, progress memory, and retries. No need to stitch together screenshot uploads or action execution yourself.
</Callout>

## Minimal setup

1. Install the SDK ([Installation](/python-sdk/installation)) and load your OAGI API key.
2. Describe the overall task and todos, then call `execute()`.

<Tip>
  **Before you run:** Ensure your desktop is clean and your browser is open. The agent needs to "see" the screen clearly to interact with it.
</Tip>

```python
import asyncio

# Captures the screenshot from your local computer
from oagi import AsyncScreenshotMaker 

# Controls your local keyboard and mouse based on the model predicted actions
from oagi import AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler 
from oagi import TaskerAgent

async def main():
    agent = TaskerAgent(api_key="YOUR_KEY", model="lux-actor-1")

    agent.set_task(
        task="Use chase to calculate IRS",
        todos=[
            "Go to chase.com",
            "Click on the 'by' of 'Investing by J.P. Morgan' on the header, then select 'Retirement and IRAs'",
            "In the header of 'Tools and resources' select 'investment calculators'",
            "Scroll down to find the 'IRA calculator' and use it",
            "Drag the monthly contribution slider to the right until it hits the maximum",
            "Drag the right side of the Age Range slider to the right until it hits the maximum",
            "After doing the steps above, scroll down to reveal the figure calculated by chase"
        ]
    )

    await agent.execute(
        instruction="Use chase to calculate IRA",
        action_handler=AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler(),
        image_provider=AsyncScreenshotMaker(),
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

That’s it: behind the scenes, TaskerAgent talks to lux-actor-1 for you, keeps a PlannerMemory of todos, and routes every action to your client-side handler.

## Understanding Tasks

To get the best results from TaskerAgent, it helps to understand how it plans and executes work.

- **Task**: The high-level goal you want to achieve. This sets the context for the entire session.
- **Todos**: A sequential list of steps the agent should follow. Think of this as a checklist you would give to a human intern.

### Best Practices for Todos
- **Be specific**: Instead of "Research", say "Search for 3 competitor pricing models".
- **Start with verbs**: "Open", "Click", "Type", "Verify".
- **Keep it linear**: Break complex workflows into simple, logical steps.

## Examples

Here are two examples of how to structure your tasks:

### Example 1: Data Entry
```python
agent.set_task(
    task="Transfer leads from spreadsheet to CRM",
    todos=[
        "Open the 'Leads' Google Sheet",
        "Copy the first row of data",
        "Open Salesforce in a new tab",
        "Create a new lead and paste the data",
        "Save the lead"
    ]
)
```

### Example 2: Market Research
```python
agent.set_task(
    task="Research pricing for 'Project X'",
    todos=[
        "Go to amazon.com",
        "Search for 'Project X'",
        "Find the top 3 rated products",
        "Record their prices in a text file"
    ]
)
```
