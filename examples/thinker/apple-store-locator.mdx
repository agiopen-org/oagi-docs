# Locate an Apple Store with Thinker

This example demonstrates how `lux-thinker-1` handles ambiguous, multi-step research tasks that require reasoning and web navigation. With a single CLI command, the Thinker model will autonomously search for the nearest Apple Store to a given zip code and retrieve its store hours.

## Why Thinker?

Finding store hours for "the nearest Apple Store" is deceptively complex:

- **Ambiguous input** — The model must interpret "nearest" relative to a zip code
- **Multi-step navigation** — Requires visiting Apple's website, entering location data, and parsing results
- **Dynamic content** — Store hours may vary by day or location

`lux-thinker-1` excels at these longer-running, open-ended tasks where the exact steps aren't known upfront.

## Run the Example

All you need is a single CLI command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Look up the store hours for the nearest Apple Store to zip code 23456" --model lux-thinker-1
```

That's it. The Thinker model will:

1. Open a browser and navigate to Apple's store locator
2. Enter the zip code and search for nearby locations
3. Identify the nearest store
4. Extract and report the store hours

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you invoke this command, the CLI triggers a workflow powered by `lux-thinker-1`:

1. **Task interpretation** — The model parses your natural language request and formulates a plan
2. **Autonomous navigation** — It controls the browser to visit Apple's website and interact with the store locator
3. **Information extraction** — Once the nearest store is found, it reads the hours and evaluates whether the task is complete

Because Thinker is designed for asynchronous, research-heavy tasks, it will take its time to ensure accuracy rather than rushing through steps.

## When to Use Thinker

This example is ideal for scenarios where:

- The task requires **research and reasoning** rather than rote execution
- You're not waiting for **immediate feedback** — Thinker runs asynchronously
- The workflow is **ambiguous** and the exact steps depend on what the model discovers

For faster, more deterministic tasks, consider using `lux-actor-1` with explicit step-by-step instructions instead.
