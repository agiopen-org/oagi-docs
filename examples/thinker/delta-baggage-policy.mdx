# Find Baggage Policy Info with Thinker

This example demonstrates how `lux-thinker-1` handles research tasks that require navigating complex websites and extracting specific information. With a single CLI command, the Thinker model will autonomously browse Delta's website and find the baggage policy for international flights.

## Why Thinker?

Finding baggage policies on airline websites is surprisingly complex:

- **Buried information** — Policies are often nested deep within help sections or FAQs
- **Context-dependent rules** — International vs domestic, cabin class, and route all affect the policy
- **Dynamic content** — Airlines frequently update their policies and site structure

`lux-thinker-1` excels at these research tasks where the exact navigation path isn't known upfront.

## Run the Example

All you need is a single CLI command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Find the baggage policy for international flights on Delta's website" --model lux-thinker-1
```

That's it. The Thinker model will:

1. Open a browser and navigate to Delta's website
2. Search for or navigate to the baggage information section
3. Locate the international flight policies
4. Extract and report the relevant baggage rules

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you invoke this command, the CLI triggers a workflow powered by `lux-thinker-1`:

1. **Task interpretation** — The model parses your request and understands it needs to find international baggage rules specifically
2. **Autonomous navigation** — It explores Delta's website, navigating through menus or using search to find the right page
3. **Information extraction** — Once the policy page is found, it reads and summarizes the key details

Because Thinker is designed for asynchronous, research-heavy tasks, it will take its time to ensure accuracy rather than rushing through steps.

## When to Use Thinker

This example is ideal for scenarios where:

- The task requires **research and reasoning** rather than rote execution
- You're not waiting for **immediate feedback** — Thinker runs asynchronously
- The workflow is **ambiguous** and the exact steps depend on what the model discovers

For faster, more deterministic tasks, consider using `lux-actor-1` with explicit step-by-step instructions instead.
