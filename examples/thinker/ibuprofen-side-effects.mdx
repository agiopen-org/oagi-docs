# Find Ibuprofen Side Effects with Thinker

This example demonstrates how `lux-thinker-1` handles medical research tasks that require navigating complex health information websites. With a single CLI command, the Thinker model will autonomously browse Drugs.com and extract the side effects of ibuprofen.

## Why Thinker?

Researching drug side effects on medical websites presents unique challenges:

- **Dense information** — Medical pages contain extensive lists of side effects organized by severity and frequency
- **Complex navigation** — Information may be spread across multiple tabs or sections
- **Context-sensitive content** — Side effects vary by dosage, age group, and medical conditions

`lux-thinker-1` excels at these research tasks where careful reading and synthesis are required.

## Run the Example

All you need is a single CLI command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Find the side effects of ibuprofen on Drugs.com" --model lux-thinker-1
```

That's it. The Thinker model will:

1. Open a browser and navigate to Drugs.com
2. Search for ibuprofen or navigate to its drug page
3. Locate the side effects section
4. Extract and summarize the key side effects

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you invoke this command, the CLI triggers a workflow powered by `lux-thinker-1`:

1. **Task interpretation** — The model understands it needs to find side effect information specifically from Drugs.com
2. **Autonomous navigation** — It explores the website, using search or menus to find the ibuprofen page
3. **Information extraction** — Once the side effects section is found, it reads and organizes the information by severity

Because Thinker is designed for asynchronous, research-heavy tasks, it will take its time to ensure accuracy rather than rushing through steps.

## When to Use Thinker

This example is ideal for scenarios where:

- The task requires **research and reasoning** rather than rote execution
- You're not waiting for **immediate feedback** — Thinker runs asynchronously
- The workflow is **ambiguous** and the exact steps depend on what the model discovers

For faster, more deterministic tasks, consider using `lux-actor-1` with explicit step-by-step instructions instead.
