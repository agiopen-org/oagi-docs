# Scraping Data with TaskerAgent 

This example demonstrates how `TaskerAgent` handles web scraping workflows that require navigation and data extraction. With a Python script, the agent will autonomously search Amazon, sort by best sellers, and collect product information.

<div style={{ padding: "62.5% 0 0 0", position: "relative" }}>

    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
    referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }}

## Why TaskerAgent?

Scraping product data from Amazon involves several challenges:

- **Dynamic content** — Product listings load dynamically and change frequently
- **Multi-step navigation** — Requires searching, sorting, and extracting data across pages
- **UI interactions** — Dropdowns and filters need precise clicking

`TaskerAgent` excels at these structured workflows where you can define clear todos and let the agent handle the execution.

## Run the Example

Create an `amazon_scraping.py` script and run it with your product:

```bash
python amazon_scraping.py --product_name "wireless headphones" --exp_name amazon
```

The TaskerAgent will:

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to Amazon
2. Search for the specified product
3. Sort results by "Best Sellers"
4. Extract information about top-selling items

## The Workflow

The workflow is defined with a simple instruction and todo list:

```python
instruction = f"Find the information about the top-selling {args.product_name} on Amazon"
todos = [
    f"Open a new tab, go to www.amazon.com, and search for {args.product_name} in the search bar",
    f"Click on 'Sort by' in the top right of the page and select 'Best Sellers'",
]
```

## Prompting Tips

This example highlights two important prompting techniques:

- **Specify UI locations** — `"Click on 'Sort by' in the top right of the page"` helps the agent locate elements reliably
- **Open new tabs** — `"Open a new tab"` prevents the agent from interfering with your existing browser sessions

## When to Use TaskerAgent

This example is ideal for scenarios where:

- The task has **well-defined steps** that can be expressed as todos
- You need **web scraping** with navigation and interaction
- The workflow benefits from **explicit location hints** in prompts
