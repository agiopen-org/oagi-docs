# Scheduling a Flu Shot with TaskerAgent

This example demonstrates how `TaskerAgent` handles complex, multi-step workflows that require form filling and navigation. With a Python script, the agent will autonomously navigate CVS.com, fill in patient details, and book a vaccine appointment.

## Why TaskerAgent?

Booking a CVS appointment involves multiple challenges:

- **Multi-step forms** — The booking flow spans several pages with different input types
- **Dynamic validation** — Fields must be filled in the correct format and order
- **Conditional logic** — Available appointments depend on location and vaccine type

`TaskerAgent` excels at these structured workflows where you can define clear todos and deliverables.

## Run the Example

Create a `cvs_tasker.py` script and run it with your details:

```bash
python cvs_tasker.py \
  --first_name="First" \
  --last_name="Last" \
  --email="user@example.com" \
  --birthday="MM-DD-YYYY" \
  --zip_code="00000"
```

The TaskerAgent will:

1. Open a browser and navigate to CVS.com's vaccine scheduler
2. Fill in contact and patient information
3. Select the desired vaccine type
4. Search for available appointments by ZIP code
5. Complete the booking flow

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you run the script, the TaskerAgent orchestrates a complete workflow:

1. **Workflow definition** — The agent receives a set of todos describing each step of the CVS journey
2. **Action handling** — `AsyncPyautoguiActionHandler` translates agent decisions into mouse and keyboard actions
3. **Visual feedback** — `AsyncScreenshotMaker` captures the screen so the agent can see what's happening
4. **Execution tracking** — `AsyncAgentObserver` records the session for debugging and export

The agent works through each todo, adapting to page changes and validation errors as needed.

## When to Use TaskerAgent

This example is ideal for scenarios where:

- The task has **well-defined steps** that can be expressed as todos
- You need **form automation** with multiple fields and pages
- The workflow requires **structured deliverables** at the end
