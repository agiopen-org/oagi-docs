# Running developer QA tasks with TaskerAgent

This example demonstrates how `TaskerAgent` can run developer QA workflows, automating repetitive testing tasks that would otherwise require manual interaction. The agent navigates applications, performs test actions, and validates expected behaviors.

## Why TaskerAgent?

Software QA automation presents unique challenges:

- **UI-driven testing** — Many applications require clicking through interfaces rather than API calls
- **Multi-step workflows** — Test scenarios often span multiple screens and states
- **Visual validation** — Some checks require seeing what's on screen, not just parsing data

`TaskerAgent` excels at these workflows where you can define test steps as todos and let the agent execute them systematically.

## Run the Example

Create a QA script and run it against your application:

```bash
python software_qa.py --app_name "MyApp" --test_suite "smoke"
```

The TaskerAgent will:

1. Launch or navigate to the target application
2. Execute each test step defined in your todos
3. Capture screenshots at key checkpoints
4. Report pass/fail status for each todo

## When to Use TaskerAgent

This example is ideal for scenarios where:

- You need **UI-level testing** that can't be done via APIs alone
- The workflow has **well-defined test steps** that can be expressed as todos
- You want **visual verification** of application state

For exploratory testing or ambiguous scenarios, consider using `lux-thinker-1` instead.
