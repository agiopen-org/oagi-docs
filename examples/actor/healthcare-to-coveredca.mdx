# Navigate to Covered California with Actor

This example demonstrates how `lux-actor-1` handles multi-step navigation across government websites. With a single CLI command, the Actor model will navigate from Healthcare.gov to Covered California's enrollment portal.

## Why Actor?

`lux-actor-1` is optimized for speed and responsiveness:

- **Fast execution** — Completes actions at near-instant speed
- **Direct control** — Perfect for "observe → decide → act" loops
- **Clear instructions** — Works best when the steps are well-defined

This task is ideal for Actor because the navigation path is explicit: click buttons, select from dropdowns, and confirm dialogs.

## Run the Example

All you need is a single CLI command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Go to healthcare.gov, click on 'Apply for coverage', open the 'Select your state' dropdown and select California, then click 'Visit Covered California website'. Press the confirmation to proceed." --model lux-actor-1
```

That's it. The Actor model will:

1. Open a browser and navigate to healthcare.gov
2. Click the "Apply for coverage" button
3. Open the state dropdown and select California
4. Click "Visit Covered California website"
5. Confirm the redirect to proceed

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you invoke this command, the CLI triggers a fast execution loop powered by `lux-actor-1`:

1. **Screenshot capture** — The agent takes a screenshot of your current screen
2. **Visual analysis** — Lux analyzes the interface and predicts the next action
3. **Action execution** — The agent performs clicks, types, and scrolls to complete the goal
4. **Repeat** — This loop continues until the task is complete

Because Actor is optimized for speed, each step executes rapidly with minimal latency.

## When to Use Actor

Actor is ideal for:

- **Immediate tasks** — When you need actions completed quickly
- **Short-horizon workflows** — Tasks completed in under 20 steps
- **Well-defined instructions** — Clear, step-by-step goals
- **Real-time control** — CLI or desktop automation loops

For complex, ambiguous tasks that require deeper reasoning, consider using `lux-thinker-1` instead.
