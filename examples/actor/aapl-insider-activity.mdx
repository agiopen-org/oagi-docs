# Finding NASDAQ Insider Activity with the Actor

This example demonstrates how `lux-actor-1` handles direct, well-defined tasks with near-instant speed. With a single CLI command, the Actor model will navigate to NASDAQ's website and find Apple's insider activity data.

## Why Actor?

`lux-actor-1` is optimized for speed and responsiveness:

- **Fast execution** — Completes actions at near-instant speed
- **Direct control** — Perfect for "observe → decide → act" loops
- **Clear instructions** — Works best when the steps are well-defined

This task is ideal for Actor because the navigation path is explicit: go to a website, search, and click through to a specific page.

## Run the Example

All you need is a single CLI command:

```bash
oagi agent run "Go to nasdaq.com, search for AAPL. Under More, go to Insider Activity" --model lux-actor-1
```

That's it. The Actor model will:

1. Open a browser and navigate to nasdaq.com
2. Search for "AAPL" using the site's search
3. Navigate to the "More" section
4. Click through to the Insider Activity page

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you invoke this command, the CLI triggers a fast execution loop powered by `lux-actor-1`:

1. **Screenshot capture** — The agent takes a screenshot of your current screen
2. **Visual analysis** — Lux analyzes the interface and predicts the next action
3. **Action execution** — The agent performs clicks, types, and scrolls to complete the goal
4. **Repeat** — This loop continues until the task is complete

Because Actor is optimized for speed, each step executes rapidly with minimal latency.

## When to Use Actor

Actor is ideal for:

- **Immediate tasks** — When you need actions completed quickly
- **Short-horizon workflows** — Tasks completed in under 20 steps
- **Well-defined instructions** — Clear, step-by-step goals
- **Real-time control** — CLI or desktop automation loops

For complex, ambiguous tasks that require deeper reasoning, consider using `lux-thinker-1` instead.
