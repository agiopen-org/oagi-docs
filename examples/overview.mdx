# Examples Overview

This section contains practical examples demonstrating the different ways to use Lux for computer automation. Each approach has distinct strengths depending on your use case.

## When to Use Each

| Approach | Best For | Trade-offs |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Actor** | Fast UI control, short tasks (under 20 steps), real-time automation | Requires clear, step-by-step instructions |
| **Thinker** | Research tasks, ambiguous goals, complex planning | Slower execution, best for async workflows |
| **TaskerAgent** | Multi-step forms, structured workflows, repeatable processes | Requires defining todos upfront |

## Actor Examples

Use `lux-actor-1` when you need speed and have well-defined instructions:

- [AAPL Insider Activity](/examples/actor/aapl-insider-activity) — Navigate NASDAQ to find insider trading data
- [Healthcare.gov to Covered California](/examples/actor/healthcare-to-coveredca) — Multi-step navigation across government sites
- [Nike Shopping](/examples/actor/nike-shopping) — E-commerce navigation with menus and product selection

## Thinker Examples

Use `lux-thinker-1` when the task requires research and reasoning:

- [Apple Store Locator](/examples/thinker/apple-store-locator) — Find store hours for the nearest Apple Store
- [Delta Baggage Policy](/examples/thinker/delta-baggage-policy) — Research baggage rules on complex airline sites
- [Ibuprofen Side Effects](/examples/thinker/ibuprofen-side-effects) — Extract medical information from Drugs.com

## TaskerAgent Examples

Use `TaskerAgent` when you have structured, multi-step workflows:

- [CVS Appointment Booking](/examples/tasker/cvs-appointment-booking) — Automate vaccine appointment scheduling
- [Amazon Data Crawling](/examples/tasker/amazon-data-crawling) — Scrape product data with navigation and filters
- [Software QA Workflows](/examples/tasker/software-qa) — Run automated UI testing tasks
